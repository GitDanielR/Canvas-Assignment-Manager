## Running the Application

### Website Mode

```bash
python website_main.py

---

## Recommend Setup

To make running the application easier without requiring Python, you can bundle the main files into standalone executables using **PyInstaller**.

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Website Executable

Build the website executable:

```bash
python -m PyInstaller --icon="canvas.ico" --add-data=".env;.env" --add-data="templates;templates" --add-data="static;static" --add-data="canvas.ico;canvas.ico" --onefile --clean --noconsole --name="CanvasAssignmentsWebsite" .\website.py
```

### Notification Executable

Build the notifications executable:

```bash
python -m PyInstaller --icon="canvas.ico" --add-data=".env;.env" --add-data "canvas.ico;canvas.ico" --onefile --clean --noconsole --name="CanvasNotifications" .\notifications.py
```

### Launching

Locate the executables in the /dist folder. Run those executables to start your programs. For automatic notifications on system startup, add a shortcut for `CanvasNotifications.exe` to your startup programs or Task Scheduler.

## Usage

### Assignment Website

1. **View assignments:** The homepage shows all current assignments from Canvas.
2. **Open assignment details:** Click a row to see assignment description and manage URLs.
3. **Add URLs/files:** Use the input box to add files/links related to the assignment.
4. **Save URLs/files:** Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù to persist the files/URLs to the local JSON file.
5. **Open all related:** Use the ‚ÄúOpen All‚Äù feature to open every saved URL/file in your browser.

### Notification System

* Can be configured to launch automatically on system start for reminders and easy access to assignments.

---

## Notes

* **Local JSON storage:** All assignment-specific URLs are stored locally. This allows persistence across sessions but is machine-specific.
* **Browser behavior:** Opening URLs uses Python‚Äôs `webbrowser` module. Default browser may depend on system configuration.
